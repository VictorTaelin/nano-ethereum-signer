First things first, massive kudos to Victor Maia for the original work

Secondly. I'm taking this refactoring exercise as source material for a web3 version of the guilded rose :-)

objective stage 0 :
- merge all lib_utils_* and lib_bytes, lib_assert - done

objective stage 1
- remove unused / dead code -> done
- clean up Buffer lib TYPED_ARRAY_SUPPORT always true -> done
- refactor to es6+ standards -> in progrss ...or code golf is a standard now?
